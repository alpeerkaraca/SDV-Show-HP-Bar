This mod shows enemies HP with a bar.

## Description
This mod has been created to display enemies health bars when playing to stardew valley. The bar displays using colors and life count indicator. The color change from green to red according to the ratio current life against max life.

The indicator will only display the health of enemies depending on the number of them have killed and your combat level.
